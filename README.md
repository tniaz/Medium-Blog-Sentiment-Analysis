# Project Description

This project allows the user to pull a user-specified blog from Medium and perform sentiment analysis. The blog is scraped from Medium.com using the BeautifulSoup API, and sentiment analysis is performed using the TextBlob API.

# Getting Started

1. Use Medium Blog Scraper.ipynb to scrape the blog from Medium.com and save it to a .txt file.
2. Perform sentiment analysis on the user-specified blog using Sentiment Analysis.ipynb.


# Troubleshooting

If the .ipynb files do not load on GitHub, please copy each .ipynb GitHub URL directly into:
